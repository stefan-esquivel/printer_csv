<p>Hello</p>

Andrew Sheret Limited (ASL) is a local company in Victoria BC, responsible for distributing
plumbing and heating equipment across Canada [1]. Mr. Andrew Sheret first opened the business
in 1892, and now it has expanded across Canada and into the online world, with its “Plumbing
Online” store. Recently, they adopted Frontier Plumbing and Heating Supply in Alberta, adding
seven more distribution branches to the business. ASL is transitioning from a small to enterpriselevel
company. This transition involves adding new members and employees, as well as building
technical capabilities. ASL’s IT development team has accomplished significant upgrades to the
company network to allow more users and services for their employees and customers. However,
with the increased number of users comes more internal company hardware, including printers,
NUCs, and terminals. While small companies need not track internal hardware, it has become
financially beneficial for ASL to do so at this size. The IT development team is now focusing on
better tracking, servicing and distributing these new devices. This report explores how hacking
and network security tools help support IT in their effort.
